The lectures covered dense and complicated aspects, but made it approachable and not so intimidating. I seriously will say that it was some of the best lecture videos that the program has offered and I can return to them in the future to learn even more. With that being said, the assignments were extremely detached from the lecture material. While the lectures were supportive, concise, laid out perfectly; the assignments were ambiguous and nuanced in ways that made the entire course a nightmare. After speaking to several students, the feeling was mutual. I would come away from the lecture material knowing the concepts, but then open the assignments and find myself incredibly lost. I have not had such an extreme disconnect in any other course. At times in this program, I feel as if I have to scream that learning does not have to be inherently difficult for it to be good content; this applies to this course tenfold. Even more so, the instructor was not approachable. There was one instance of a student asking the instructor for guidance and the instructor referred the student to a different course saying that they should have learned it then. I was curious, so I checked the course the instructor mentioned, not only did I not take the course yet either, but it was also not a prerequisite for the Data Mining II. The instructor continuously came off as standoff-ish, egotistical, and arrogant in Slack communications. This was also reflected in the assignment where it was unnecessarily difficult and detached from the lecture material so much so that I did not get anything from it, even after passing each assignment with full points. I have never had a pure, negative experience from an instructor or course in this program. Each instructor has been kind, considerate, and open to assist on big/small issues. Also, even on the assignments where I found myself lost in our courses, I could at least find my way eventually and I gained something from it. This course and instructor, unfortunately stand out as the complete opposite. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,187,23

Some instructors also assume far too much about what is taught in previous classes. There is a huge gap between what some instructors assume was taught in previous classes and what was actually taught. Moreover, context is critical. If you haven’t seen a particular type of problem before, it is extraordinarily difficult to understand how everything fits together without first being taught. I’ve done very well in this program, but in too many classes we are basically expected to teach ourselves. We are paying tuition with the expectation of being taught the skills we need, and that is not happening in some classes.

A few classes needed a LOT of reference outside the course. Others have not been as much. I think some searching outside the course is fine and acceptable. It's the classes where a lot of reference outside the course means to me the course should provide more information/instruction if the majority of the class is having this experience. Looking back I think 502 was the worse. If this was the first course anyone took I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't continue. ","10,11,13,14,17,18,21",8,8,2,3,3,1,4,"This course did cover the objectives of the course overview. The assignment of writing the manifesto in this class, being the first class one is guided to take for the program, is not appropriate. The assignments for this class would be good if specific tasks were actually shown (of course, not in detail), including the general information obtained when accomplishing the task and what one might conclude from those tasks and then possibly asked questions along those lines.
The reason I don't believe the manifesto assignment is not appropriate is because you're asked to ""come up with something"" / make something up and then stick with that ""story"" throughout. I don't think it's appropriate to make up something and on top of it you don't know enough about the details of various tasks to provide good detail.  
The interviews of current data scientists were good in order to get an idea of what some do.  These were also good to see a variety of things different data scientists do.
I think the manifesto is a good idea but I think it would be a better project for towards the end of the program. It was mentioned in one of the lectures that people use these to help get a job. I again, don't think this is a good thing coming from the beginning of the program. It's a very nice paper but it should be based on things we have done.
I did like Prof. Resnick's teaching.
I also thought the current instructor and GSI's did a fine job. I think the assignment(s)/project needs to be changed. ",3,3,2,5,5,1,2,"This class could be great. I think the assignments are fine but the lectures do not support the material. Yes, they discuss the topics but they do not at all align. I am good at math and usually enjoy it but this class was not enjoyable. For the most part I was unable to use the instruction to solve the problems. I had to consult YouTube and many other sources to refresh my memory or to learn what was taught. The amount of time trying to solve the problems trying to use what was taught was ridiculous. I found solving the problems either based on my own logic or by the other resources found made them much more reasonable. This was very clear when it came to the problems regarding probability. I was able to get the correct answers drawing venn diagrams and not by using the formulas provided. 
I did like the assignments, providing I had the proper instruction. This is why I marked this class as Very Challenging. It should not have been.
I was also dissappointed in the instruction. The GSI's did a fabulous job. I don't think the instructor did a very good job of explaining things either and I recall him answering ""I don't know."" to one question someone asked. My thoughts on ""I don't know."" is it's fine to give that answer but if you do you should also be willing to look into it and get back to people. Unfortunately I don't remember what the question was in order to justify to what extent he should have been responsible for that question but I believe there was at least some merit to the question deserving more.  For another question, a very long answer was provided that didn't really answer the question. The student asking the question very politely said ""thank you"" in the end. I think the teachers need to be aware that just because the students say ""thank you"" it doesn't mean they truly answered the question. I hate to say that because most of the time the teachers do answer the question. I think the teachers need to ask themselves if they truly feel good about the answer they provided. I think this teacher had to know what a poor response it was and that the student wouldn't be able to use the information provided to answer the problem. ( I know this didn't help that student because I helped him a day or two later.)
I did like the tutorial information provided in a jupyter notebook at the beginning of the course. I think there could be a little more added to it with some explanation as to why you might use one thing over another. (This is difficult to provide suggestions for without some examples.) I think the biggest thing here would be to re-do the lecture videos and teach towards the assignment, giving similar examples as the problems in the assignment. 
I don't think by making students take a lot of time to figure something out they're necessarily learning from it. Sometimes doing something repetitively makes something sink in more. Instead of making students spend all their time getting to the answer, provide them with better instruction to make it easier and then have them do more to reinforce it.
This class took a lot more time than it should have.
This class was not worth the $$ and is a poor example of a class.",,,,,,,,,9,9,3,2,2,2,8,"This was a good course. I enjoyed the instructor as well. 

I don't think the instructor has a good idea about how long it takes students to accomplish some of the tasks.  I'm having a little difficulty remembering specifics to provide better input.

I did learn quite a bit in this course and it's a good base for continuing on with the program. There's room for some improvement but this was one of the best classes in the beginning portion of the program.",4,4,5,4,4,1,3,"Looking at the course overview, the course did go over those topics mentioned. Being that this class teaches SQL and that it's a graduate level course, I expected a bit more advanced SQL to be introduced. I do believe the instructor noted why some more advanced techniques weren't taught and if I remember correctly it's because they wouldn't be good to use in certain situations but everywhere I've worked those more complex techniques were used and needed.
This class was too simple. It's great that those things that were taught were good but more instruction would be better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,8,3,2,3,2,7,"I'm unsure if some of the feedback I have for this is worthwhile. I enjoyed looking at another visualization tool on my own for this but I'm not sure what I gained from that except to know I can look into something else. One possibility to gain more insight about other tools available is to be shown several and to see some of the pros and cons about them instead of spending time focusing on one. There's not enough time in a week to get into the details of more than one on your own and then determine which tool you'd like to use. To do a good job with this project you pretty much have to pick a tool and go with it so you can spend the time figuring out what you want to show and then how to do it with that tool. Although I liked what I learned from the project.
One down side to this course was the introduction to the qq-plot. I think the instructor is aware of this and this isn't news to him. I believe he provided some instruction and assignment using the qq-plot in order to show us something we may learn at a later point in time but at the same time, we did not learn it well and putting it to use did not turn out well. I think the intentions were good but maybe the lesson here is to stick with teaching the subject at hand and have students learn it well without complicating it with something potentially needlessly time-consuming since it's not something we should focus on at this time. I had the assignment complete and then all the questions came up about this. I then spent much time trying to figure out if what I did was correct, when in the end I used what I had and it was fine. This is what I mean by needless amounts of time spent.
Again, I think the instructor means well and it's clear he cares about the students and their learning which is wonderful. This is a good class but narrow down what needs to be taught/learned.
The project for week 4 was also good but I think the wording of it makes you feel like you need to find something fabulous to show and adds a lot of stress to something that shouldn't be quite as difficult as it is. Here I think the teacher was trying to be fun and make it fun but in turn adds stress. ",9,9,2,2,1,3,9,"This course was great but more challenging than need be - often more challenging means more hours spent than should be. It's clear that the documentation for altair is not great. There's not a lot of external resources available for this course either. The altair tutorial at the beginning of the course was great. I think what would be useful is more instruction, possibly through a video, of the logic behind the layering of the charts and when and where configuring things works. It was difficult to figure out which part of the chart, or which chart, or which step, the different configurations would work. 
I think altair is very nice looking and I liked learning it and look forward to learning more except for the fact that I also know how hard it is to find the information needed to be able to do what you want. 
As always, the GSI's were wonderful and helpful. The instructor did a fine job too but the course could use more instruction on how to use the tool besides instruction of visualization concepts.
I would recommend this course but I would more happily recommend this course providing more instruction on altair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,10,4,1,1,3,10,"This was a great course.

If the videos and readings in a class only discuss the fundamental concepts and ignore the implementation of these concepts in Python then the in class learning materials will take a backseat to what I can find on Google. 

If the intention of these courses is for students to figure almost everything out on their own then at least 2/3rds of the professors have succeeded.

Also, I LOVE the flexibility and the wide range of courses offered through the one month system. However, when I am asked how the program is going, I think the perfect analogy is going to college to learn Japanese to become a Japanese interpreter. I have some foundational knowledge, but nothing close to interpreter skill level. In class they teach you many very interesting and useful things about Japanese history/culture, then the homework assignment is to talk about everything you learned - but in perfect Japanese. I am very aware that learning how to look up techniques/code online is an essential skill (I have taught myself a few languages already that way), but the entire purpose of taking formal classes is to have that road paved a bit more to learn more efficiently. I have spent up to 35 hours on one class's weekly assignment (slated for 3 hours) because so little of what I needed to do was actually taught. I could have learned those skills with 1 hour of good training, but instead wasted massive amounts of time in a near-panicked state while neglecting my pregnant wife and toddlers. Also, due to the high anxiety I felt during that and similar classes, I am able to retain very little of what I learned.

I like the fact that every course is a month long and we have flexibility for each course, but this also has the drawbacks of some courses lack any real depth and you don't get to engage in the material in a meaningful way while other courses seem like they are stretching for material to fill in 4 weeks of content.  I think the program would be greatly enhanced if there was flexibility to plan courses in more formats than just a 4 week structure.  

Some of the courses I have enjoyed most were the visualization courses.  While Altair was challenging to learn, it was rewarding.  I took I and II back to back so it felt like one 2 month course and I was able to get more out of it.  In addition, the human grading aspect was a nice difference rather than just auto grader for everything. 

The over reliance on auto graders in this degree has also been a frustrating experience.  Often I find that I am approaching a question in the correct way but spending too much time to match my answers to what the autograder is looking for.  In programing, there is often more than one approach to solve a problem but an all or nothing grading approach from an auto grader is frustrating.  I understand that the cost of the degree is built around an autograder as well but from my experience with other online courses I have taken has shown me there are different ways to structure grading.  For example if there are 20 tests to pass, the grader could let students know what percent of tests are being passed and give grades accordingly.  This also allows for types of differentiation rather than almost every single student getting an A in each course.

The over reliance on autograders I feel also does not encourage best coding practices.  I felt like the only course than emphasized this was pipelines.  This is an real area I feel like I need to improve in but there are limited opportunities in the program.

This survey is a game changer. Lots of interesting points being thrown around - it seems as though you guys are thinking about expansion into other realms of possibility, which is huge. I think on-campus courses would be really cool, and I also think that courses spanning multiple months would be beneficial as well. I just hope I'm around in the program long enough to see it all come to fruition! 

It's been a fantastic program thus far. I can say with complete honesty and enthusiasm that I've become a more critical and analytical thinker after having taken just half of the curriculum. Throughout my career, I've had imposter syndrome to a degree, especially around things like ML and NLP (and Python in general, for that matter), but I knew that my toolkit could be expanded by learning these tools - I'm elated to report that this syndrome has been pretty much alleviated. I have no fears or doubts about approaching Python with a can-do attitude, and I've leveraged it/many of the techniques we've learned numerous times in my day job as an analyst.

What I enjoy most about the courses are the assignments. While some are better than others, ALL of them have enabled me to think critically about the content being taught, and I've become very, very adept at troubleshooting code and conducting external research to solve problems, which, let's be honest, is an absolute must in industry. And of course, I've picked up a ton of practical data science knowledge along the way.

The community on Slack has also been a huge plus. Although I don't believe that any medium can replace in-person classes and the prototypical collegiate lifestyle (I recall my Bachelors in Ann Arbor fondly), Slack allows for the next best thing, in my opinion. I've made a couple of friends along the way that I'll probably keep in touch with after the program is over, which is awesome. Also, communication with MADS staff has always been prompt, thorough and helpful, for which I am grateful.

For those of us in the Metro Detroit/Ann Arbor area, I absolutely believe that MADS-sanctioned meetups/events could be super cool to. Apologies if I've missed them over the course of my tenure in the program.

One other thing - It's been brought up prior, but I also think it would be great if you gave academic honors distinctions upon graduation (summa cum laude, magna, etc.). I feel as though this would be a great benefit for the program to offer, and it would prompt further alignment with the structure of more traditional programs.

All in all, though, It's been a great time so far. I've learned a ton, and I've had a blast doing it. It's been a hell of a lot of work, but who doesn't love a good challenge, right?

While some were well-prepared and discussed the key concepts/road map for each week’s lectures/assignments with clear slides and organisation, some did not prepare anything in office hours and solely used this time to answer questions (if any).  In case of no questions from students, some simply used this time as a chat/social event.  Like others, it would be much better for them to prepare something for each week’s office hours and can instead use this valuable time to explain/summarise the key concepts in course materials/assignments each week.  For only very few courses, they are very good that they included enrichment topics (which is a very good idea for other courses to follow) in weekly office hours from lecturers/TAs.
- It is desirable to provide and demonstrate more hands-on Python coding applications for the materials in each course.
- It seems that the criteria for giving an A+ is not well-organised.  Some courses did not give any A+ at all although students got very high marks, which is undesirable.
- One-week schedule for assignment is sometimes rather intense, especially for part-time students.  Suggest having a two free late day per month for each course. 
- Suggest having a distinction classification for MADS graduates for those with high GPAs

MADS has been a decent program so far, with only of couple of courses 502 and Deep Learning needing rework. 502 should be completely rewritten if it hasn't already. Deep learning needs 2 additional courses to match the umich undergrad and/or stanford versions. The current deep learning class should be renamed to Basic Concepts of Deep Learning.

2. Some of the talk has been about the classes being too easy. I'm not sure that is the problem . If students really take notes from the lectures and read the readings, you'll learn a lot and it actually takes many hours per week more than the Coursera listed estimate. 

Yes, the homework is easier if all you are trying to do is pass the autograder. But I like most of the homework so far because it also gives enough time for the freedom to experiment. Try to understand each question carefully and then write several versions of the code, (without looking at Slack or stackoverflow at first), timing the code and trying different ways to achieve the answer has helped me understand better. 

The classes are only 1 month long so the homework has to be doable on a busy schedule and I think it's been good so far with a few exceptions.

I think ""too easy"" might be mixed up with ""class not thorough enough"" maybe. In Deep Learning for example, I found the lectures too short and not enough to do the homework. Basically I spent most of the time googling and then put a few short sentence answers in the homework, pray I understood it and hope the feedback comes back in time before next week. A better homework (not necessarily harder) would be to guide you through coding the different types of  neural networks, coding different parameters and comparing the results and then helping the student understand the different results.

3. Some great examples of homework were in 505, 522, 524, and Data Mining I and II, 542, 543. They walk you through the concepts, and by the end you have reiterated what was supposed to be learned in the class. And I think they make great study guides to refer back to.

4. The presentation oriented classes like 503, 523, 524 I think help differentiate MADS from other school's programs. Understanding the why, the ethics and how to present them effectively will really help prepare students for leadership someday. I've really enjoyed those classes as well. 

5. Comprehensive Altair guide. 522, 622 and I hope someday a 722? were *GREAT* classes, but Altair is poorly documented. Much of the struggle was figuring out how to do something that would otherwise seem absolutely trivial in another technology. I personally spent dozens of hours on the last 5 percent of a chart. And I think many students worked into the night, probably many all nighters on stuff.

6. Better baseline content in office hours. Some cases there is literally a blank video because no one showed up. On the other hand, Nick Sheltrown probably has the most thorough and well prepared and helpful office hours, and in some cases more substantive and more important to watch than the actual class lectures! Bravo! 505, 522, and Data Mining I and II, 542, 543 and 622 generally had good office hours too, especially when it is the professor who is doing it.

7. Keep up to date if possible. Deep learning didn't really cover transformers or things like tensorflow. Andrew Ng, keeps talking about being data centric,... good data vs big data, would be great to have a course on that some day.

By ""flow"", I mean the style of the assignments/lectures/readings stays somewhat consistent.  

For Example, Deep Learning could be included under a similar style as Supervised & Unsupervised.  As another example, Math Methods could be improved by having someone related to the later classes develop the lectures & curriculum so it flows into what we learn later. 

Another broad comment is that while I am in my final semester, I feel very unprepared for any ""production"" type of data science project, including the capstone.  I feel confident in my ability to produce analysis in Jupyter Notebooks, but not even able to confidently create a small project where I need to store my own data somewhere and have a UI that someone can use in real time.  Perhaps the addition of the Cloud Computing elective will address some of this in the future, but one suggestion could be to require (maybe as one of the milestones) all students to use U. Michigan's server resources to host a very small sized project so can apply some of these things (with guidance) that we learned in ML Pipelines and the Database courses.

Other students may be more advanced with GitHub so rather than making these extra GitHub assignments mandatory, they could be made optional. If we could also learn about DevOps, Kubernetes, and how to setup automated reporting with APIs that would be awesome.

There's no depth of materials coverage. I feel like I just brute force most of the time to get pass the auto-grader. They often divert to ""we have office hours"" to address any questions in addition to the pre-recorded lectures, but I can't attend most of the office hours because I'm a super busy working professional and can't make the in-office hours attendance (e.g. 11AM/4PM on a regular day). In addition, how am I supposed to contribute thoughtful input during office hours but I just turned in homework yesterday and then the office hour happens the next day? If the spread the format out to 2 months or more, everyone would be better off.","11,14,22",,,,,,,,,1,3,3,5,5,1,1,Horrible materials and mismatched between learning outcomes and coverage.
